### Pre-release Process

We support pre-release versions for testing new features before stable releases:

#### Creating Pre-releases

**Beta Releases** (for testing stable features):

```bash
# Create a beta branch
git checkout -b beta

# Make your changes and commit with conventional commits
git commit -m "feat: add new search feature"

# Push to beta branch - this triggers beta release
git push origin beta
```

**Alpha Releases** (for experimental features):

```bash
# Create an alpha branch
git checkout -b alpha

# Make your changes and commit with conventional commits
git commit -m "feat: experimental vector search"

# Push to alpha branch - this triggers alpha release
git push origin alpha
```

#### Pre-release Versioning

- **Beta releases**: `1.1.0-beta.1`, `1.1.0-beta.2`, etc.
- **Alpha releases**: `1.1.0-alpha.1`, `1.1.0-alpha.2`, etc.

#### Installing Pre-releases

```bash
# Install beta version
pnpm add typesense-search-plugin@beta

# Install alpha version
pnpm add typesense-search-plugin@alpha

# Install specific pre-release version
pnpm add typesense-search-plugin@1.1.0-beta.1
```

#### Promoting Pre-releases

When a pre-release is ready for stable release:

1. **Merge to main branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge beta
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **The stable version will be automatically released** based on the commits

#### Pre-release Guidelines

- **Beta releases** should be feature-complete and tested
- **Alpha releases** can contain experimental or incomplete features
- **Document breaking changes** in pre-release commit messages
- **Test pre-releases** in development environments before production use
- **Provide feedback** on pre-releases through GitHub issues

#### Pre-release Testing

Before creating a pre-release:

```bash
# Run full test suite
pnpm test

# Build and analyze bundle
pnpm build
pnpm analyze

# Test in development environment
cd dev
pnpm dev
```
